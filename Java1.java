//////// Varaible, Data Types,Operators and input/output in Java ////////

/*
 * write a java program to calcualte the area of shapes like circle,rectangle and triangle
 * using switch case the user will choose the shape and provide the necessary input to calculate the area.
 * the switch case should be inside the while loop so that the user can calculate the area of multiple shapes until they choose to exit.
 * Use appropriate data types and operators to perform the calculations.
 * use different classes and methods to organize the code. like Shape, Circle, Rectangle, Triangle etc.
 * should all be in a class called shapes and the methods eg circleArea(), rectangleArea(), triangleArea() etc.should be inside the class shapes.
 * the class should be define in the main class of the program so the methods can be called from the main method.
